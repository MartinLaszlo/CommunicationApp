ReactJS and Python based communication application which uses an algorithm to put students into teams using a fully functional ELO system. Featuring private and public chats as well as functional file uploads and video/image embedding.
Note that to run the app, you must download the necessary icons and all else, files are organized the way they are as to make reading all the code easier.

The app is fully functional, 
Created by me and a friend (https://github.com/DimitrovViktor) over the course of 2 weeks.
